    <h1>DISNEY</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>I'm an avid fan of anything Disney. Living in Southern California for all of my life, 
        I have been fortunate enough to be able to have Disneyland passes. Growing up we would spend
        countless weekends there and it pretty much made me who I am today. Disney has taught me that 
        no matter the age, the gender, the race, your beliefs, anybody can have fun and be a kid. 
        Your reality is fueled by your imagination and as long as your imagination keeps running, the magic will never run out.
