    <h1>WEIGHTLIFTING</h1>
    <hr />
        <h2>Weightlifting has been one of my passions since I was a sophomore in highschool. 
            Playing sports growing up, I loved the aspect of lifting weights to let out emotion 
            and to sort of lose myself in the pain and gain of it all. It is my safe space and 
            my meditation as I like to step back from the aspects of life, and work on myself 
            for an hour or so. Nothing else matters, just pushing myself past expectations. It helps me reset mentally and physically and gives me a sense of accomplishment.
