    <h1>ANIME</h1>
    <hr />
        <h2>Anime is something I picked up recently. I never thought in a million years I would like anime 
            becuase I thought of it as too "nerdy". Little did I know, anime has some of the best story lines
            and animation you will find. <br /><br />
            
            My top animes are:
            <ol>
                <li>Jujutsu Kaisen </li>
                <li>Demon Slayer</li>
                <li>Solo Leveling</li>
                <li>Attack on Titan </li>
            </ol>
